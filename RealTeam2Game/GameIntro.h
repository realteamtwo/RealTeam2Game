//game introduction starting with backstory, (setting, how you got here, where is it, what is your goal),
//followed by controls so player knows what to do


//Backstory rough draft: A teleportation spell has gone wrong and you find yourself in an unfamiliar room.
//You must seek a way out, traveling down until you reach the ground level to flee the evil alchemist's tower!

//controls rough draft: To descend the Tower, you must open the trapdoor in the middle of each room,
//which will often be locked in some way. The method to do so is hidden in the room. Investigate,
//solve puzzles and use items.
//While exploring the Tower, you will find various *items* and *objects*. Such items will be helpful
//in solving puzzles. To look at an item, type "inspect [item name]", for example "inspect torch" will
// briefly describe what the torch looks like and if it is lit or not. To use an item, type "use [item name]"
//for example "use torch" will light the torch while "use key" will try to use key on lock. Objects
//can also be moved, for example "move vase".
//to see what items are around you, type "look" and you will get an idea of what's around you including
//stuff you can interact with.
//once you have solved the room, type "open trapdoor" to open and descend further.
