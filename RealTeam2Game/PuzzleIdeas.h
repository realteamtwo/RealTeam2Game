//this is where we can put puzzle ideas I'll give a base idea of a few but others can add some -nicole

//Dark Room Puzzles
//Idea#1 Darkness
//Type: Room Trait
//Items: Torch
//Description: The dark room is so dark without a light source the player can't see and therefore can't progress
//as a side note if they try to look around a prompt should come up "it's so dark I can't see anything".
//Solved by "use torch" causing it to be lit
//Idea#2 Glow in the dark
//Type: Item interact
//Items: Torch 
//after progressing long enough in dark room there should be something that they need to put out torch for.
//once they "use torch" again to get rid of light, a glow in the dark code to something (exit perhaps?)
//should be visible so the player will now have the code. Since this puzzle isn't intuitive a hint should be there.
//something like "the secret is hidden in the dark" or "shines brightest in the dark"

//Air Riddle Idea: What travels in the daylight but casts no shadow? What can you feel but you cannot see?
//Answer: air
